"""requirement_trace gate — every plan step traces back to an acceptance criterion.

A plan can be safe and well-ordered yet still drift from the user story it was
meant to deliver. This gate checks that every plan step references at least one
acceptance criterion bound to the goal, and flags steps that satisfy no
criterion as ``step_not_traced_to_criterion``.

The finding is a WARNING for backward compatibility — legacy plans without
``satisfies`` fields are not broken, just untraced. Under strict posture the
loop controller will escalate on any finding.
