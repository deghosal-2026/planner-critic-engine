"""verification_ordering gate — a verified mutation's verification must not be vacuous (#219).

A high-blast-radius task that carries a :class:`VerificationStep` is asserting
"after my action runs, this check proves the result". That assertion is only
meaningful if no consumer of the mutated state acts before the verification
point. This gate pins the **inline-after-task** semantics: a task's
verification executes immediately after its own action, before the next
linear task begins.

Under those semantics two deterministic cases make the verification vacuous:

* **Reversed order** — a hard-dependency consumer ``U`` of high-risk task
  ``T`` appears *before* ``T`` in linear order. ``U`` acted on the
  pre-mutation state and ``T``'s verification can never bless what ``U``
  consumed. (``ordering_sane`` also fires on this shape; both findings are
  kept because they report different defects — the ordering violation and
  the verification-staleness consequence.)
* **Parallel race** — a sibling ``U`` shares ``T``'s ``parallel_group`` and
  mutates the same ``target``. Group members run concurrently, so ``U`` may
  overwrite the target before ``T``'s verification executes.

Both fire as a gate-layer BLOCKER with reason code
:data:`~planner_critic.reason_codes.VERIFICATION_AFTER_CONSUMER` — the LLM
critic never votes on it, closing the under-claim direction at this seam.

**Data-subject contract (#230).** Consequences key on what the consumer's
verification reads, not on position alone:

* subject = **pre-state** (derivation convention: ``what`` begins with
  ``"pre-state"``) → must run BEFORE the mutate. Placed there, it is
  legitimate and never flagged — this is the guarantee that stops the gate
  from training users into moving every check early. Placed after, it reads
  a world the mutation already replaced → flagged.
* subject = **output** (default) → must run after; consumers running before
  the mutate are flagged as above.

v0.3.0 evolution: optional ``subject: Literal["pre_state", "output"] | None``
on ``VerificationStep`` replaces the prose-prefix derivation. The field is
optional with default ``None`` = current derived behavior; plan-store
round-trip is lossless because older serialized plans simply omit it.
