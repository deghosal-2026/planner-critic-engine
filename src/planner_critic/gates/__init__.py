"""Deterministic critique gates — the free, injection-immune layer (F-12).

These gates are pure code operating on the typed plan; they never touch a
model, so a goal crafted to corrupt the plan cannot weaken them. Each gate
returns :class:`~planner_critic.types.Finding` objects — gates never raise
on malformed input; they report a finding instead.

:func:`run_deterministic_gates` is the single entry point the loop calls,
and it runs every gate in a stable order.

.. note::
   ``parallel_safety`` is M1-scoped to its schema-level counterpart: it
   audits the unsafe cases the :class:`PlanVersion` constructor permits by
   design (e.g. parallel tasks whose preconditions race). See
   docs/design/plan-schema-design.md for the exact responsibilities split.
