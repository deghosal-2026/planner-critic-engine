"""The pluggable plan store (F-09, PRD §2.1): versioned plan persistence.

The store is a **side channel**: planning proceeds in memory if the store is
down (with a warning), and is persisted when healthy (§7.2). The protocol is
kept framework-agnostic — :class:`PlanStore` speaks typed Pydantic models, and
a concrete implementation (in-memory for tests, SQLite for production) merely
has to round-trip them losslessly.

Every plan version, its critique findings, escalations, and execution traces
are first-class, so the full draft→critique→revise→approve→execute history is
diff-able and replay-able (§2.1 items 5 and 7).
