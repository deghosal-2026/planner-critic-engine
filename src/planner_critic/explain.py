"""Loop-decision explain engine (F-80, CUJ 15): human-readable narratives.

The explain engine takes a plan's stored revision history plus its escalation
record (if any) and produces a structured :class:`ExplainResult` whose
narrative lets a reviewer understand *why* the loop decided what it did —
approved, escalated, or still running — and what changed between revisions.
