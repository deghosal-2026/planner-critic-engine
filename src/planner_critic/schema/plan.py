"""The typed plan schema (F-02, F-15): the versioned planning artifact.

A :class:`PlanVersion` is the immutable currency of the engine. Every
revision the planner produces is stored as a new, immutable ``PlanVersion``
linked to its parent, so the full draft→critique→revise history is
diff-able and replay-able.

Per PRD §2.8 the schema carries explicit parallel/branch semantics beyond
plain dependency edges: tasks declare a nullable ``parallel_group`` (tasks
in the same group run concurrently) and optional :class:`Branch` objects
express fan-in/fan-out shape with a join mode.

Structural invariants enforced at construction time:

* task ids are unique,
* every dependency endpoint and branch reference resolves to a task,
* a ``parallel_group`` may not contain a task id (tasks, not groups, are
  members), and a hard dependency may not exist *between* two tasks of the
  same ``parallel_group`` (they run concurrently — a contradiction).
