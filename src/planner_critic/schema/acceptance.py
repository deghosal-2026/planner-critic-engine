"""Frozen acceptance-criteria contract (#215).

The criteria and the approving authority are bound **before execution
starts**. The planner and critic may revise the graph, but they can never
change what "passing" means for the run already in flight:

* :func:`bind_acceptance` snapshots the goal's posture into an immutable
  :class:`AcceptanceContract` with a content hash.
* :func:`evaluate_contract` is a pure function of ``(findings, contract)`` —
  approval reads the bound posture, never ambient config.
* :func:`revise_contract` never mutates: it returns a new contract with an
  incremented version and the prior hash preserved for audit. Changing the
  rules mid-run therefore forces a new lineage instead of easing the current
  one.
