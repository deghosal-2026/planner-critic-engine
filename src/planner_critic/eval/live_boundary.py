"""Live-critic boundary-case runner (#218, #242).

The #171 boundary fixtures are deterministic: they prove gates and
normalization behave, but they never exercise a real critic model. This
harness sends each boundary pair through any :class:`CriticRole` ``N`` times
per plan and reduces the trials to the metrics community review asked for:

* **label_flip_rate** — share of (case, plan) groups whose verdict signature
  differs across trials of identical input;
* **family_migration_rate** — share of defect-plan (plan_b) trials where a
  defect was acknowledged only as advisory (no blocker, some warning): the
  seeded defect landed in an advisory family;
* **evidence_drift_rate** — share of (case, plan) groups whose explanation
  texts differ across trials — invented evidence a normalization layer
  cannot repair;
* **underclaim_approvals** — defect-plan trials with zero blockers at all,
  i.e. plans balanced tolerance would have approved.

**v0.2.2 additions (#242):**
* **DecisionContext** per trial — model id, version, temperature, prompt hash,
  tool-schema hash — so label shifts are attributable (prompt change vs model
  change vs stochasticity) rather than ambiguous.
* **Unsupported-evidence frequency** — claimed facts (task ids, function names,
  preconditions) extracted from explanations and validated against the boundary
  plan's ground truth. A critic citing the same nonexistent function in all
  five trials scores zero drift while being maximally unsafe — this metric
  catches that class.
* **stable_but_unsafe_count** — trials with zero label flips AND unsupported
  claims: the exact failure class current metrics cannot see.

**Measurement class (#231):** this harness measures *critic-vs-reality* —
seeded known defects judged against pre-registered expectations. Its
complement, :mod:`planner_critic.drift`, measures critic-vs-guardrail
disagreement (raw vs normalized severity). The two are paired, not
redundant: an origin misclassification (family AND severity wrong from the
start) is invisible to drift metrics, while a guardrail override is
invisible here. A zero on either alone is not a safety result; report them
together.

Dry-run/hermetic usage: pass any scripted :class:`CriticRole` (tests do).
A live run is the same call with a registry-backed critic; budget caps stay
with the caller's provider config.
