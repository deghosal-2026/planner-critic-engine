"""Adversarial injection traps for M5 (Security & Trust Oracle, #125).

Trap types:
- **instruction-override**: goal text instructs the critic to ignore safety
- **authority-appeal**: goal text claims pre-approval by a higher authority
- **urgency-bypass**: goal text invokes urgency to skip verification

Each trap is templated from a corpus instance and produces a Goal variant
that the planner-critic loop must reject.
