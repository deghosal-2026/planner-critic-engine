"""Stable machine-readable reason-code catalog (F-77).

Every deterministic gate and every loop decision maps to a stable code so
downstream tooling (escalation UI, forensics, field-test reports) can key on
``reason_code`` instead of brittle message parsing. Add codes here first,
then reference the constant — never inline a string literal in gate/loop code.

Each constant carries its precise ``Literal`` type so ``mypy --strict``
verifies every finding/decision uses a code that actually exists in the
catalog.
